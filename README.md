# 🎨 CNNs on CIFAR-10 Dataset 🖼️

![CIFAR-10 Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cifar-10/cifar-assets/main/logo.png)

## Overview 📚

This repository contains my work on implementing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset, a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. The project explores different CNN architectures and hyperparameter tuning strategies to improve model performance. Starting with a basic CNN model, I iteratively refine it by experimenting with various techniques such as learning rate schedules, batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation.

This repository demonstrates how changing hyperparameters can impact the model's accuracy and provides a learning path to better understand CNN behavior on small-scale datasets.

## Project Highlights 🚀

- **Models Used**: CNN with multiple layers, pooling, dropout, and batch normalization
- **Techniques Applied**: Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs), data augmentation, and optimizer adjustments
- **Framework**: Implemented in Python using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**

## Key Experiments 🔬

1. **Basic CNN Model**:  
   A simple CNN with two convolutional layers, max-pooling, and a fully connected layer.
   
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - **Learning Rate Schedules**: Tried step decay and cyclical learning rates.
   - **Batch Normalization**: Improved generalization by adding batch normalization layers.
   - **Dropout Regularization**: Applied dropout to reduce overfitting.
   - **Optimizers**: Compared SGD, RMSProp, and Adam.

3. **Data Augmentation**:  
   Leveraged techniques such as horizontal flips, random cropping, and rotation to artificially expand the training set.

## Course Reference 🎓

This project is inspired by the course [Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10](https://www.udemy.com/course/dl-guided-project-image-classification-with-cnn-on-cifar-10/learn/lecture/43996880?start=330#overview). It covers the foundational concepts and hands-on implementation of CNNs for image classification tasks.

## Future Work 🔮

- Adding transfer learning with pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG16).
- Exploring more advanced regularization techniques like CutMix and MixUp.
- Implementation of ensemble methods to further improve accuracy.
